<b>Generating text from American Sign Language (ASL) using keypoint data and an encoder-decoder architecture is a promising leap in accessibility technology. ASL is a vital means of communication for the Deaf community, but its understanding is not universal. This innovative approach leverages computer vision to capture ASL gestures as keypoint data and translates it into written text.The encoder processes the keypoints, extracting meaningful information, while the decoder converts this data into a coherent text representation. This technology holds immense potential for bridging communication gaps between Deaf and hearing individuals, making information and conversations more inclusive. It's a significant step toward a more inclusive and connected world, demonstrating the power of AI to break down barriers.</b>
